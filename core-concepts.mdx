## Understanding Oasis Protocol Architecture

Oasis Protocol introduces several core concepts that form the foundation of its secure and private Web3 platform. These concepts work together to provide confidentiality, scalability, and interoperability for decentralized applications.

## Confidential Computing

Confidential computing is the cornerstone of Oasis Protocol. It allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without exposing the underlying information to unauthorized parties, including the cloud provider or other network participants.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="How It Works" icon="settings">
    Confidential computing uses hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) combined with cryptographic techniques to ensure data privacy during processing.
    
    <Callout kind="info">All Oasis Protocol nodes run within secure enclaves that protect data integrity and confidentiality.</Callout>

      <Step title="Data Encryption" icon="lock">
        Data is encrypted before entering the secure enclave.

## Runtime Off-chain Logic (ROFL)

ROFL enables verifiable off-chain computations that can be attested on-chain. This allows complex computations to be performed outside the blockchain while maintaining cryptographic guarantees of correctness.

<Expandable title="ROFL Applications" default-open="true">
  ROFL is particularly useful for AI inference, complex financial calculations, and privacy-preserving data analysis.
  
  <CodeGroup tabs="Solidity,JavaScript">
    ```solidity
    // ROFL contract example
    contract ROFLApp {
      function submitComputation(bytes32 inputHash) external {
        // Submit computation request
        rofl.submit(inputHash);
      }
      
      function verifyResult(bytes32 resultHash) external {
        // Verify off-chain computation result
        require(rofl.verify(resultHash), "Invalid result");
      }
    }
    ```
    ```javascript
    // Client-side ROFL interaction
    const rofl = new ROFLClient();
    
    // Submit computation
    const requestId = await rofl.submitComputation(inputData);
    
    // Wait for result
    const result = await rofl.getResult(requestId);
    console.log('Computation result:', result);
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Attestation Process" default-open="false">
    ROFL computations include cryptographic proofs that attest to the correctness of off-chain execution.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Integration Examples" default-open="false">
    ROFL can be integrated with existing smart contracts to add privacy-preserving computation capabilities.

## Confidential EVM Compatibility

Oasis Protocol provides a confidential Ethereum Virtual Machine that maintains full compatibility with existing Ethereum tools and applications while adding privacy features.

<Callout kind="tip">Developers can use familiar Ethereum development tools like Hardhat, Truffle, and MetaMask with Oasis Protocol.</Callout>

## Getting Started with Oasis Protocol

Oasis Protocol provides a secure and private platform for Web3 and AI applications. It focuses on confidentiality, scalability, and interoperability, enabling the creation of a better web. With a confidential Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that's secure and interoperable by design, plus verifiable off-chain compute via ROFL, Oasis empowers developers to build decentralized applications with enhanced privacy.

Oasis Protocol stands out by integrating confidentiality into the core blockchain infrastructure. This approach ensures that sensitive data remains protected while maintaining full compatibility with existing Ethereum tools and applications.

## Core Features

Oasis Protocol introduces several innovative features that set it apart in the Web3 landscape. The confidential EVM allows smart contracts to execute private computations while maintaining public verifiability. This is achieved through advanced cryptographic techniques that protect sensitive data without compromising blockchain transparency.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  // Initialize Oasis SDK
  const oasis = new OasisSDK({
    network: 'mainnet',
    confidential: true
  });
  
  // Deploy confidential contract
  const contractAddress = await oasis.deployContract(bytecode);
  console.log('Contract deployed at:', contractAddress);
  ```
  ```python
  # Initialize Oasis client
  from oasis_sdk import OasisClient
  
  client = OasisClient(network='mainnet', confidential=True)
  
  # Deploy confidential contract
  contract_addr = client.deploy_contract(bytecode)
  print(f'Contract deployed at: {contract_addr}')
